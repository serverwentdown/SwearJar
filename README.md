# SwearJar

A simple side-scrolling single-platform game to entertain you when you're bored. Or it may allow you to enjoy the satisfaction of catching someone swearing red-handed without feeling judged. 

There are five characters you can choose from as your avatar, each with different attributes. The antagonist of the game is a single angry person who swears randomly. Your obstacles are teachers who will distract you from following the antagonist and collecting swears from them through conversations with you.

Also, don't fall off the edge of the "map".
